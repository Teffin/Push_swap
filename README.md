# Push_swap is a School 21 project. The purpose of this project is to create sorting algorithm.

# Push_swap usage: ./push_swap list_of_numbers_given_as_parameters

# To check the commands we use the checker, which could be called in this manner:
# ./push_swap number_list | ./checker number_list
# The checker prints OK if the first stack is sorted and the second stack empty, and KO if anything else.
# flag -v (visual flag)
# flag -t (test flag without checker)
# flag -s (score steps)
# flag -d (on sleep fun)
# flag -- (end_flag)
